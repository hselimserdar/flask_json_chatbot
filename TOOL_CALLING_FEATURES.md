# üß∞ Chatbot Tool Calling Features

Your Flask chatbot now has **web search** and **mathematical calculation** capabilities powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash with tool calling!

## ‚ú® New Features

### üîç Web Search
- **What it does**: Searches the web for current information using DuckDuckGo API
- **When to use**: Ask questions about current events, recent information, facts, or anything that requires up-to-date knowledge

4. **Results are integrated** into the AI's response seamlessly
5. **User receives** a comprehensive answer with real-time data or calculations

### Security Features
- **Math calculations**: Uses safe evaluation with restricted functions
- **Web search**: Rate-limited and uses trusted DuckDuckGo API
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks if tools fail

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Web Search Examples
**User**: "What are the latest developments in artificial intelligence?"  
**Bot**: *[Searches web and provides current AI news and developments]*

**User**: "Find me information about Flask web framework"  
**Bot**: *[Searches and provides comprehensive Flask information]*

### Math Calculation Examples
**User**: "I need to calculate 25% of 840"  
**Bot**: *[Calculates: 0.25 * 840 = 210]*

**User**: "What's the area of a circle with radius 7?"  
**Bot**: *[Calculates: œÄ * 7¬≤ ‚âà 153.94]*

## üìù Notes
- Tools work for both **authenticated users** and **guest users**
- **Automatic detection**: The AI decides when to use tools based on context
- **Seamless integration**: Tool results are naturally incorporated into responses
- **Fallback handling**: If tools fail, the chatbot continues with its base knowledge

Enjoy your enhanced chatbot with real-time search and calculation capabilities! üéâ
